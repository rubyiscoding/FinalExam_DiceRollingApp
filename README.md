# DiceRollingApp

This is a simple Android app developed as part of the final exam of first semester. The app allows users to simulate rolling dice with different numbers of sides (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20) using a user-friendly interface. Users can choose a specific die, roll it once, or roll it twice to see the results. The app also provides the option to customize the number of sides for a die. Additionally, the app supports both light and dark themes for an enhanced user experience.
